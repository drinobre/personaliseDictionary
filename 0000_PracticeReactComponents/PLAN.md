## Components Tree

- App
  -- Next
  -- More and Less

## Implementation Plan

### Initiate React and Structure Folder convention

- Init React (npx create-react-app)
- Create the folder Components > App and add the app files automatically created by React
- Rename the import from APP and Reat image
- Test the APP (npm start)

### Creating components

- Create separate folders for each component, which will be rendered on the main APP (for example, buttons, display)
- Create the index.js file into each component, which they will handle a function containing a return in JSX format.
  Note: the return must be inside a <div> or <> tag
